### Intro

Ever since the first version was released in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been a staple piece of kit for professionals, hobbyists, educators and everyone in between. And for good reason, it's small, low power, affordable but extremely versatile. There are of course other single board computers on the market, but the Pi has a strong community behind it and provides a good balance between capabilities, form factor and price.

### Raspberry Pi Projects

Here is a curated list of projects that I have used, enjoyed and would recommend for anyone looking to put their Pi to use. For links to each projects GitHub repo, see: [https://github.com/stars/Lissy93/lists/raspberry-pi](https://github.com/stars/Lissy93/lists/raspberry-pi)

(Alternatively, build a Google Home, using [Voice Kit](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/) or an [Alexa](https://mytechbuild.com/2021/03/07/build-a-raspberry-pi-amazon-echo-in-7-steps/))

There is almost no limit to what you can do with a Pi, this list is just intended to serve as an example and a provide a starting point.

### Operating Systems

Raspberry Pi can also be used as a normal computer; either a desktop, mini handheld or headless as a server. You're not just limited to [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), it also works very well with [Debian](https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/), [FreeBSD](https://wiki.freebsd.org/action/show/arm/Raspberry%20Pi?action=show&redirect=FreeBSD%2Farm%2FRaspberry+Pi), [Arch](https://archlinuxarm.org/), [Kali](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/), [Slackware](https://rpi.fatdog.eu/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/raspberry-pi) to name a few.

For more specific use cases, there's also [Diet Pi](https://dietpi.com/) (super light-weight OS specifically for single-board computers), [OpenElec](https://openelec.tv/) (lightweight system for running a Kodi media center), [Windows IoT Core](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10iotcore), [OCMC](https://osmc.tv/) (media center), [Emteria Android](https://emteria.com/) (for Android) and [Chromium OS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/chromnium-os-for-all-sbc/files/Raspberry%20Pi%20Images/) (similar to open source alternative to Chrome OS), [Nems](https://nemslinux.com/download/nagios-for-raspberry-pi-4.php) (for network monitoring) and [many more](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/534/definitive-list-of-operating-systems)

* * *

### Self-Hosted Applications

Once running an OS of your choice, the Pi is also perfect for self-hosting Linux applications. For example;

*   [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) - Smart home dashboard and controller
*   [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) - Network attached storage with plugins
*   [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) - Full productivity platform
*   [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) - Media server
*   [Sonar](https://sonarr.tv/) - Smart Media Downloading for BitTorrent
*   [NetData](https://www.netdata.cloud) - Real-time system resource monitoring
*   [StreamLink](https://howchoo.com/pi/how-to-set-up-steam-link-on-raspberry-pi) - Stream your PC games to your TV (or your Plex content, with [RasPlex](http://www.rasplex.com/))

... and [tons more](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted)

If you're interested in self-hosting multiple apps, or using your Pi as a little home server, then check out [Home Lab OS](https://homelabos.com/) by [Nick Busey](https://gitlab.com/NickBusey), it makes correctly configuring a complex lab as easy as running a single command.

### Tools for Flashing SD Card/ USB

For flashing an OS to you're Pi's SD card or USB: [Official Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or use the [dd](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/dd.htm) (CLI utility on Unix systems). [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) and [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) are also good utilities, but only available on Windows.

To backup you're Pi's SD card of USB, you can also use `dd` (the same as cloning, but in reverse). For example:

*   Backup: `sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdb of=PiOS.img`
*   Restore: `sudo dd bs=4M if=PiOS.img of=/dev/sdb`

For more information, see [this tutorial](https://www.cyberpunk.rs/clone-micro-sd-card). Alternatively, on Windows systems, you can use [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) to clone the SD card.
